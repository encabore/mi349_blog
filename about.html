            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <img alt="Portrait of Red Encabo" width="256" height="256" src="portrait.jpg">
            <p>I am a senior attending Michigan State University who will graduate with a major in mathematics and a minor in information technology next year in the spring. One of the few careers that I want to pursue is web development, which I have been dedicated to for several years. As a freelancer web developer, I have accomplished the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Built distinct websites for the Assembly of Filipino Catholics in Michigan and WKDT Radio of the United States Military Academy at West Point to improve audience engagement.
                <li>Collaborated with other students using WordPress and PHP to develop an independent web-based simulator.</li>
                <li>Customized over one hundred unique cards with Adobe Photoshop and Microsoft Word for birthdays and graduation parties.</li>
                <li>Redesigned over five school webpages entirely from HTML, CSS, and Javascript using Bootstrap and Skeleton frameworks to improve student navigation.</li>
                <li>Held meetings with other established front-end developers and IT administrators to maintain and update website information.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I also play the piano for several choirs, a few of whom requested their own website (refer to above). Another hobby that I am interested is photography, and while I do not consider myself a professional photographer, many of my friends believe that I could be one. Having the opportunity to shoot beautiful, striking photos is primarily why I am interested in travel.</p>
