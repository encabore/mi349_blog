            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I am a senior attending Michigan State University who will graduate with a major in mathematics and a minor in information technology next year in the spring. One of the few careers that I want to pursue is web development, which I have been dedicated to for several years. As a freelancer web developer, I have accomplished several things.</p>

                <figcaption>Selfie at Cuyahoga</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>I also play the piano for several choirs, a few of whom requested their own website (refer to above). Another hobby that I am interested is photography, and while I do not consider myself a professional photographer, many of my friends believe that I could be one. Having the opportunity to shoot beautiful, striking photos is primarily why I am interested in travel.</p>
